                        The ULF wave activity starts on May 16, presents two short peaks before
12:00 UT and after noon it remains at the lowest power with characteristics
of continuous geomagnetic pulsations. On the 17th, around 11:00 UT there is
a new signal increase, with continuous characteristics, possibly related to an
increase in the solar wind speed. Between the 18th and 19th, activity
remains reduced, with some peaks, mainly at high latitudes, also recorded
by the GOES satellite. The disturbances increase on May 20, also recorded at
low latitude, by EMBRACE magnetometers.

                        * In the week of 05/17 to 05/23, the following events related to geomagnetic activity stand out:
* Data from the Embrace magnetometer network showed instabilities throughout the period, no significant events in the last period
* Geomagnetic activity was unstable throughout the AE index, with the Dst index oscillating around zero. Highest Kp of the week was 3+
*  The auroral activity was slightly intensified on the 20th and 22th of May.

# Scintilation 
 ## Responsible: Siomel Savio Odriozola 
 
In this report on the S4 scintillation index, data from SLMA in São Luiz/MA, STSN 
in Sinop/MG, STNT in Natal/RN and SJCE in São José dos Campos/SP are 
presented. The S4 index tracks the presence of irregularities in the ionosphere 
having a spatial scale ~ 360 m. 
The SLMA, STSN and SJCE stations did not show relevant values of the S4 index 
throughout the week. The STSN station in Sinop, presented, at the same time on 
the 18th and 19th of May, S4 values close to 0.7. Figure 1 shows the map with 
satellites recorded by STSN in the time interval between 1200(UT) to 1500(UT) 
on 05/19 (top panel) and between 1130(UT) to 1500(UT) 05/20 (bottom panel) 
and with S4 values > 0.2. The same satellite (G9) appears to be solely 
responsible for the high values recorded in this time interval, which indicates an 
extra geophysical cause in the high values of S4 in Sinop.
