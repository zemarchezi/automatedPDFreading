                     High-energy electron flux (>2 MeV) in the outer boundary of the outer radiation belt obtained from geostationary satellite data GOES-16 and GOES-17 (Figure 1) is stable around the threshold 103 particles/(cm2 s sr) throughout the week of analysis. Three electron flux decreases were observed on May 4th, 8th, and 9th, respectively. The first decrease is considerably rapid, returning to the threshold of 103 particles/(cm2 s sr). The second decrease reaches approximately 1 order of magnitude and persists for more than 9n hours. The third electron flux decrease reaches approximately 2 orders of magnitude and persists until the last record.    

The GOES-16, GOES-17, and Arase satellite data are analyzed and interpolated to observe the high-energy electron flux variability (1 MeV) in the outer radiation belt (Figure 2). Additionally, the VERB code rebuilds this electron considering the Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) waves' radial diffusion. The simulation (VERB code) shows that the first electron flux decrease occurs only at the outer boundary of the outer radiation belt, the second reaches L-shell = 6.0, and the third reaches L-shell – 5.0. These electron flux variability occurred concomitantly with the arrival of solar wind structures and ULF wave activities. However, it is important to point out that the data from the ARASE satellite are not available for the week under analysis to confirm the L-shell level of these electron flux variabilities.\section{ULF Waves}

                     The ULF wave activity shows an increase in power from the 3rd of May in
the form of irregular and short-duration pulsations, detected from high
latitudes to the magnetometers at low latitudes of the EMBRACE network
(Figure 2, SMS), the same activity repeats on May 4th. The activity continues
until the 7th of May with reduced power. On day 8, there is a further
increase in spectral power, now with continuous characteristics, mainly at
high latitudes. This period is possibly under the effect of a corrotant
interaction region (CIR) and also periods with an increase in the density of
the solar wind and component of the magnetic field of the solar wind
predominantly in the south direction.

\section{SCintilation} 
 \subsection{Responsible: Siomel Savio Odriozola} 
 
In this report on the S4 scintillation index, data from FRTZ in Fortaleza/CE, STSN 
in Sinop/MG, UFBA in Bahía/BA and SJCE in São José dos Campos/SP are 
presented. The S4 index tracks the presence of irregularities in the ionosphere 
having a spatial scale ~ 360 m. 
The stations STSN, STNT and SJCE did not present relevant values of the S4 
index throughout the week. In the FRTZ station, a case appeared with S4 values 
above 0.4. The most important was recorded in the morning of 04/25 (Figure 1, 
upper panel). In the lower panel of Figure 1, the affected satellites located to the 
northwest of the FRTZ appear. Ionograms at the same time and location show 
the typical spread in the main trace. This fact together with the position of 
satellites with S4 values > 0.15 shown in the Figure 1 indicate the presence of an 
irregularity in the ionospheric plasma due to a typical plasma bubble at this time 
and at these latitudes close to the geomagnetic equator.

    \section{ROTI} 
 \subsection{Responsible: Carolina de Sousa do Carmo} 
 
ROTI did not show significant variations related to ionospheric irregularities during the week. However, it is interesting to mention that some structures appear in the northern region of Brazil every day of the week. However, this region has low spatial coverage of GNSS receivers, and there are also the border's effects on the maps, causing an error propagation in this specific region.
